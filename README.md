# A Simple Mobile Survey App with Algorithm and Recommendation:<br/><br/>
1.) The user must login to their account or register if they have not already done so. When registering, users must enter their email address, password, and confirm password, as well as their age, name, and username. They must also check the Terms and Conditions box before clicking the Create Account button or they will be unable to register.<br/><br/>
2.) Their information will be saved to a real-time database using Firebase, but the password will not be. Only email, username, password, username, and age are listed here. Every user will have their own UID. The database can only be accessed, read, and written by an admin.<br/><br/>
3.) They will be taken to the Homepage or main activity shortly after logging in, where they will notice links or navigations for the Survey Form, Sleep Assessment Form, Logout, and About Us.<br/><br/>
3.1) Their information, such as their complete name, username, email address, and age that they use to register, is also contained in or displayed on the main activity or site.<br/><br/>
4.) Editable text fields, check boxes, radio buttons, and buttons for the user to complete the form are all included in the survey form button or action. When they press the submit button, it will be saved to the user database for that particular user.<br/><br/>
4.1 ) When they click the button, they will be prompted if there is at least one checkbox or text field that is empty. The data will not be sent and the survey will not be finished.<br/><br/>
5.) The major point is presented last, similar to the Survey form but using an algorithm. Once the user completes the survey and saves their data to the database, the algorithm will begin to function. Once finished, a recommendation using an algorithm will be displayed in the main activity. Based on the information they provided and the checkbox and radio button selections, the algorithm will function.<br/>
